I a steady and productive climb into equipment engineering developing many software systems and applications along the way. From 87C52 device microcode for high speed servo applications to multi-process multi-threaded desktop graphical applications I have to hone my skills building industrial strength software for the global market. My most recent project involved developing blob analysis applications for wafer map processes using MS Visual C#. I continue to development my own products maintaining my software skills using the latest leading edge technology.WORK EXPERIENCELTS Software Engineer Computational LithographyIBM Corporation - September 2011 to PresentRe-engineering of unit test processes that guarentee functionality of all Perl based applications used for IBM's Computational Lithography Processes.

This was a 20000 line program written in C using OS2's presentation engine which allowed the user to graphically display the part under test and manipulate it to produce alignment and height mapping points. It also allowed an off-line method of optimizing a test sequence.Visual Test Generator. I invented an offline OS/2 graphical application to generate a test file from the device's net list called the Visual Test Generator. This required many optimization algorithms and enabled the test engineer to graphically refine a test program for maximum optimization.Programming TechnicianIBM Corporation - July 1983 to June 1986PC Chip In Place Test Automation. Our team transformed an existing tester into a fully automatic functional chip tester. Utilizing ARTIC technology and Intel 87C51 embedded microcontrollers we developed multitasking real time software to control various pieces of the tester using C and PLM.CIPT Automatic Alignment. Automatic alignment of test probe to pads was accomplished using Cognex machine vision and custom application code that we developed using C. This project also required us to develop a pre Windows GUI screen management system.Module Assembly Tool Diagnostics.

American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygienehttp://www.ajtmh.org/content/88/4/630.shortFebruary 4 2013Published AbstractIn this study we evaluate the effect of participatory Ecohealth interventions on domestic reinfestation of the Chagas disease vector Triatoma dimidiata after village-wide suppression of the vector population using a residual insecticide. The study was conducted in the rural community of La Brea Guatemala between 2002 and 2009 where vector infestation was analyzed within a spatial data framework based on entomological and socio-economic surveys of homesteads within the village. Participatory interventions focused on community awareness and low-cost home improvements using local materials to limit areas of refuge and alternative blood meals for the vector within the home and potential shelter for the vector outside the home. As a result domestic infestation was maintained at ä__ 3% and peridomestic infestation at ä__ 2% for 5 years beyond the last insecticide spraying in sharp contrast to the rapid reinfestation experienced in earlier insecticide only interventions.Household model of Chagas disease vectors (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) considering domestic peridomestic and sylvatic vector populations. Journal of Medical Entomology http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1603/ME12096May 7 2013Published AbstractDisease transmission is difficult to model because most vectors and hosts have different generation times. Chagas disease is such a situation where insect vectors have 1äóñ2 generations annually and mammalian hosts including humans can live for decades. The hemataphagous triatominae vectors (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) of the causative parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) usually feed on sleeping hosts making vector infestation of houses peridomestic areas and wild animal burrows a central factor in transmission. Because of difficulties with different generation times we developed a model considering the dwelling as the unit of infection changing the dynamics from an indirect to a direct transmission model. In some regions vectors only infest houses; in others they infest corrals; and in some regions they also infest wild animal burrows. We examined the effect of sylvatic and peridomestic vector populations on household infestation rates. Both sylvatic and peridomestic vectors increase house infestation rates sylvatic much more than peridomestic as measured by the reproductive number R0. The efficacy of manipulating parameters in the model to control vector populations was examined. When R0 > 1 the number of infested houses increases. The presence of sylvatic vectors increases R0 by at least an order of magnitude. When there are no sylvatic vectors spraying rate is the most influential parameter. Spraying rate is relatively unimportant when there are sylvatic vectors; in this case community size especially the ratio of houses to sylvatic burrows is most important. The application of this modeling approach to other parasites and enhancements of the model are discussed.Vector blood meals and Chagas disease transmission potential United States. Emerging Infectious Diseaseshttp://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/4/11-1396_article.htmApril 2012Published AbstractA high proportion of triatomine insects vectors for Trypanosoma cruzi trypanosomes collected in Arizona and California and examined using a novel assay had fed on humans. Other triatomine insects were positive for T. cruzi parasite infection which indicates that the potential exists for vector transmission of Chagas disease in the United States.Chagas Disease: Trypanosoma cruzi the first hundred years Triatomine Biology Chapter 8http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/bookseries/0065308X/752011Published AbstractA complete picture of Chagas disease requires an appreciation of the many species of kissing bugs and their role in transmitting this disease to humans and other mammals. This chapter provides an overview of the taxonomy of the major species of kissing bugs and their evolution. Knowledge of systematics and biological kinship of these insects may contribute to novel and useful measures to control the bugs. The biology of kissing   bugs their life cycle method of feeding and other behaviours contributing to the transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi are explained. We close with a discussion of vector control measures and the allergic complications of kissing bug bites a feature of particular importance in the United States.A method for the identification of guinea pig blood meal in the Chagas disease vector Triatoma infestanshttp://www.kinetoplastids.com/content/6/1/1Published AbstractBackgroundIn a SINE-based PCR assay a primer set specific for guinea pig genome short interspersed elements DNA was used to test the utility of genomic markers for identifying the source of vertebrate blood meals of Triatoma infestans.MethodsThe investigation consisted of two assays. In Assay 1 thirty-six insects collected from the Province of Zuda’Ån’€ez in Chuquisaca Bolivia were frozen 1äóñ40 hours after feeding under controlled conditions on guinea pigs. The species of the vertebrate host was confirmed from dissection of the posterior part of the abdomen of each insect followed by DNA extraction and PCR amplification. Assay 2 investigated whether the technique worked under field conditions. We analyzed the bloodmeal of 34 insects collected from households and peri- domestic structures from communities where wild and captive guinea pigs occur. After collection the insects were maintained at room temperature for 2 months without feeding and then analyzed.ResultsIn Assay 1 each of the 36 insects allowed to feed on guinea pig blood tested positive for guinea pig DNA. The guinea pig DNA was reliably identified in as little as 1 hour and up to 40 hours after feeding. For Assay 2 8 out of the 34 samples (23%) showed positive results with guinea pig specific primers.ConclusionThe results in assay 1 demonstrated that DNA from the vertebrate host can be amplified 1äóñ40 hours post feeding from the abdomen of the blood-feeding Chagas disease vector Triatoma infestans. The results in assay 2 confirmed that the procedure works on insects collected from households and peri-domestic structures and that the source of a blood meal can be determined at least 2 months post feeding.PCR reveals significantly higher rates of Trypanosoma cruzi infection than microscopy in the Chagas vector Triatoma infestans: High rates found in Chuquisaca Bolivia http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/7/66June 27 2007Published AbstractBackgroundThe Andean valleys of Bolivia are the only reported location of sylvatic Triatoma infestans the main vector of Chagas disease in this country and the high human prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in this region is hypothesized to result from the ability of vectors to persist in domestic peri-domestic and sylvatic environments. Determination of the rate of Trypanosoma infection in its triatomine vectors is an important element in programs directed at reducing human infections. Traditionally T. cruzi has been detected in insect vectors by direct microscopic examination of extruded feces or dissection and analysis of the entire bug. Although this technique has proven to be useful several drawbacks related to its sensitivity especially in the case of small instars and applicability to large numbers of insects and dead specimens have motivated researchers to look for a molecular assay based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as an alternative  for parasitic detection of T. cruzi infection in vectors. In the work presented here we have compared a PCR assay and direct microscopic observation for diagnosis of T. cruzi infection in T. infestans collected in the field from five localities and four habitats in Chuquisaca Bolivia. The efficacy of the methods was compared across nymphal stages localities and habitats.MethodsWe examined 152 nymph and adult T. infestans collected from rural areas in the department of Chuquisaca Bolivia. For microscopic observation a few drops of rectal content obtained by abdominal extrusion were diluted with saline solution and compressed between a slide and a cover slip. The presence of motile parasites in 50 microscopic fields was registered using 400í„ magnification. For the molecular analysis dissection of the posterior part of the abdomen of each insect followed by DNA extraction and PCR amplification was performed using the TCZ1 (5' äóñ CGA GCT CTT GCC CAC ACG GGT GCT äóñ 3') and TCZ2 (5' äóñ CCT CCA AGC AGC GGA TAG TTC AGG äóñ 3') primers. Amplicons were chromatographed on a 2% agarose gel with a 100 bp size standard stained with ethidium bromide and viewed with UV fluorescence.For both the microscopy and PCR assays we calculated sensitivity (number of positives by a method divided by the number of positives by either method) and discrepancy (one method was negative and the other was positive) at the locality life stage and habitat level. The degree of agreement between PCR and microscopy was determined by calculating Kappa (k) values with 95% confidence intervals.ResultsWe observed a high prevalence of T. cruzi infection in T. infestans (81.16% by PCR and 56.52% by microscopy) and discovered that PCR is significantly more sensitive than microscopic observation. The overall degree of agreement between the two methods was moderate (Kappa = 0.43 Œ± 0.07). The level of infection is significantly different among communities; however prevalence was similar among habitats and life stages.ConclusionPCR was significantly more sensitive than microscopy in all habitats developmental stages and localities in Chuquisaca Bolivia. Overall we observed a high prevalence of T. cruzi infection in T. infestans in this area of Bolivia; however microscopy underestimated infection at all levels examined.ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SOFTWARE PROFICIENCYEndNote X6 5 yearsEsri ArcGIS 10.1 8 years Genepop 6 yearsGraph Pad Prizm 6 2 years MATLAB R2012 5 years Microsoft Office 11 years Sequencher 5 yearsSAS JMP V10 Pro 6 years Structure 7 yearsINVITED PRESENTATIONSNovember 2012. äóìProbing for indicators of Chagas disease risk.äóù Meegid XI: 11th International Conference on Molecular Epidemiology and Evolutionary Genetics of Infectious Diseases Loyola University New Orleans Louisiana.September 2012. äóìLandscape risk factors associated with Chagas disease infestation in Zurima Bolivia.äóù Biology Symposium at the Universidad San Francisco Xavier de Chuquisaca Sucre Bolivia.January 2011. äóìHome alone?

A dynamic model has been designed to track the desired torque about the ankle and regulate the force-pressure behavior inside a pair of pneumatic muscle-tendon type actuators enabling the mean pressure (stiffness) of the pneumatic actuators to be inflated slowly but deflated quickly mimicking the energy return of biological muscles and tendons. A robot module and linearly actuated knee pivot have been designed to ensure the cyclic mass (energy) transfer from heel strike to toe off.Applications of the Running Simulator: Will increase the realism of footwear tests at an economic cost while maintaining a high repeatability. It will enable manufacturers to design shoes or prosthetic feet to reduce stresses inflicted on the runner by simulating the performance of the shoe or foot over its life cycle in a factory environment.Future work: The next step is to build a working model to validate the entire system design. Once validated the presented Computer Aided Design can be manipulated in a simulation package and controlled by the dynamic model in a pure computational simulation.

These included a new enclosure design for a flat panel computer to be used as an operator interface. The new design reduced weight by a factor of three while also reducingmanufacturing cost and addressing major cooling issues for the LCD and computer. As well I designed and built an X-Ray enclosure to house an in-process Electron Beam system. This enclosure was a complex labyrinth path for a printing web to pass through while keeping X- Rays in. Construction was formed and welded sheet metal to form a mold that then had lead cast in place.Lead R&D StaffiRobot Corp - Jaffrey NH - April 1997 to April 2003 Member (E5) Design of mobile robots.

Milford NH: Manufacturer of intelligent mobile robots. Lead R&D Staff Member.Real World Interface was a young company of fifteen people hoping to move from a start up business to a profitable manufacturing company when I started. My first mission was toestablish engineering controls on the manufacturing process.This included establishing a part numbering and naming system with revision control for everything from software to resistors and gears. Many assemblies were only sketched on scraps of paper without dates or titles. From this we grew to a state where it was clearly known whatwe were building and what we needed to do it. Lead time for robot orders went from 1 year to just a few weeks. Cost of Goods sold on these products went from 85% to less than 45%.Jake Kittell 722 Darling Rd.802-888-1679 Jake@HappinessTech.biz Morrisville VT 05661Having achieved this I moved on to design work for the next generation of robots. I hadprimary design responsibility for our line of three All Terrain Robotic Vehicles. These arerugged outdoor vehicles that can navigate serious terrain while carrying up to two powerfulPCs. There are now several hundred of them serving the needs of robotic researchers from universities to national laboratories and US military defense programs.iRobot Corp - 1999 to 1999merged with I.S.

My father a Principal Scientist (engineering) at Hughes/ Perkin ElmerCorporation worked mostly from our home. He is among the world's experts on micropositioning having done such things as achieve positional stability of good sized mirrors to the angstrom level for 12 hour periods. Together we made assemblies that traveled in the spaceshuttle and designed the machine that has polished many of the world's largest telescopemirrors (including the Hubble's). Facilities included a precision machine shop as well as thorough electronics and metrology capabilities. During this period I invented a machine todistribute mercury in arc lamps in a few seconds' time for Perkin-Elmer's lamp factory. Thisprocess was previously done by hand requiring skilled workers ten minutes per lamp.Opportunity was not spared to educate me in the ways of a craftsman. Craftsmanship is anever-ceasing desire to improve the product process and methods of what we do. I learnedthat attention to detail is the path to a quality finished product. Craftsmen look to the nextlevel of performance even as the present one is being developed. I learned the skills to take aproblem and develop solutions using sketches and analytical techniques to build precision parts and produce finished machinery and to make detailed drawings from the point of view of ashop person. This has been a great aid in winning the respect of shop personnel in myprofessional work.My Grandfather on my mother's side invented the first process to separate color images into dots for printing by Time magazine that is the foundation of modern color printing. He was anearly pioneer in television and made the first non-military radar installation aboard a sea vessel while at GE. From him I gained the courage to invent whatever needs to be invented. Thisthree generation long tradition of breaking new ground continues through my work.Related SkillsPeople who work with me believe in my abilities to solve tough problems and to deal with them in a fair and honest way. Patience allows me to be methodical and thorough in my work and is the basis for a strong knack for having inventions work well on the first attempt.

A total of 51 distinct 16S rRNA amplicon libraries were constructed from universal V4 primers (515F /806R) and sequenced using the 454 Titanium GS FLX platform. The sequences produced were analyzed using the Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology v.1.8.0 (QIIME). The goal was to determine if the disease was caused by a possible microbial causative agent. This research was also part of the Earth Microbiome Project.Other research positions involved participating on the Porifera Tree of Life Project which focused on defining the phylogenetic relationships within Porifera that still remain unsolved. In particular the monophyly of the Porifera phylum and its largest class; Demospongiae has been questioned and the relationships among its major lineages. The lack of a robust phylogenetic hypothesis for this phylum hampers progress in basic studies of sponge biology biodiversity comparative evolutionary studies and efforts to conserve sponges. The goal was to provide a phylogenetic context that would improve the understanding of all aspects of sponge biology (https://www.portol.org/). I was specifically working on identifying the genetic differences between sponge species using 18S rRNA and 28S rRNA analysis. The analyses included using software such as Geneious to evaluate sequences. I also assisted on both sub-projects of the BP oil and dispersant exposure experiment. The first looked at the effect of BP oil and dispersant on the microbial communities of sponge Cinachyrella australiensis. I evaluated a region of the 28S gene to determine is the sponge samples themselves all belonged to the sample species or if some represent a unknown subspecies. I also completed the RNA extraction for samples which looked at the Cinachyrella australiensis gene expression change to the BP oil and dispersantSkills UsedWhile I was employed I demonstrate the ability to work independently and within a team.
