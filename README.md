# Machine learning basics

This repository contains implementations of basic machine learning algorithms in plain Python (Python Version 3.6+). All algorithms are implemented from scratch without using additional machine learning libraries. The intention of these notebooks is to provide a basic understanding of the algorithms and their underlying structure, *not* to provide the most efficient implementations.
